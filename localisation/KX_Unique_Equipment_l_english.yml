jezail_equipment_0_desc:0 "Jezails are generally handmade weapons, and are consequently widely varied in their construction. Jezails are seen as very personal weapons, and unlike most military weapons which are plain and utilitarian, jezails tend to be well-crafted and intricately decorated. The jezail is a muzzle-loading long arm that typically has a smooth bore and its firing mechanism is usually either a matchlock or a flintlock. The Jezail is an archaic weapon in this day and age."

Most of the improvised weapons made by the rebels, the majority of whom were from the Kikuyu tribe, exploded when they were fired."

From autogyros, gyroplanes, and gyrocopters like those designed by Juan de la Cierva, Raúl Pateras Pescara, and Harold Pitcairn, to more modern true helicopters designed by the likes of Engelbert Zaschka and Igor Sikorsky, these new VTOL aircraft will allow us to operate in airspaces once thought far too cramped and hazardous for traditional aeronautical infrastructure. Multipurpose in nature, designed to aid in a variety of applications from recon and transport to bombing and ground support, these new helicopters will bring our military to new heights!."
