### Integration Decisions
integrate_china: "Establish Administration/Reintegrate Concessions"
integrate_china_desc: "We only need one government. Although we have bested threats on battlefield, a set of campaigns to dismantle the support bases of our rivals, to seize their assets, and abrogate their treaty ports will be necessary to ensure our future peace. Our government has reclaimed territories that belongs to our former enemy. Establishing local administrations is critical to our future success.[GetIntegrateChina]"

### Army Reform
china_army_decisions: "Army Reform"
china_army_decisions_desc: "Chinese armies have long struggled to catch up to Western standards. Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines.\n"

china_shared.1.d: "The United Front may have brought a measure of unity to our fractured country, but the internal conflicts between Chinese factions never truly ended. Now, our losses in the face of the Japanese invasion have forced our government to recognize a simple truth: we can no longer claim to be China's leader in the face of foreign invasion. Already forces under various warlords and regional governments have begun routinely ignoring our directives in favor of those from [current_china_leader.GetNameDef]. Unless we push forward and retake our lost territory we stand to permanently lose our leadership status."
china_shared.1.a: "Drat."

china_shared.2.t: "A United Front"
china_shared.2.d: "With Japan's invasion beginning to gather steam, [Root.GetLeader] has decided to make a call for national unity against the invader, even if it means fighting alongside our former enemies. Even as the country's communication infrastructure has come under threat, the message will go out at once - by courier if necessary!"
china_shared.2.a: "For China!"

china_shared.3.t: "A Call For Unity"
china_shared.3.d: "Scholars, intellectuals, and various idealogues have made calls for national unity against foreign aggression routinely over the years. It has been a nice rallying cry, if one that often fell on deaf ears. Now, with Japan's invasion rolling across a significant portion of the country,[From.GetNameDef] has made a call for a temporary alliance against Japan, and this time perhaps other leaders will listen. Even the most cynical must admit that China's fate seems to hang in the balance."
china_shared.3.a: "Yes, we must band together."
china_shared.3.b: "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the United Front"
china_shared.4.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has joined the United Front, pledging all their resources and influence to the anti-Japanese cause. This will not bring an end to any historical rivalries, or claims to legitimate national leadership, but nontheless our troops will now be fighting side by side against the foreign aggressor."
china_shared.4.a: "Excellent."

china_shared.5.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Betrayal"
china_shared.5.d: "In an act of wanton betrayal, [From.GetNameDef] has refused to join the United Front. There can be no excuse for putting individual interests before the fate of all China!"
china_shared.5.a: "Traitors!"

china_shared.6.t: "[current_china_leader.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Ceasefire"
china_shared.6.d: "With [From.GetNameDef] joining the United Front, [current_china_leader.GetNameDef], has offered to broker a ceasefire between [From.GetNameDef] and our regime, solely in the national interest, until such a time as the Japanese invasion is halted. The agreement is conditional on the transfer of all occupied territories on both of our sides, however."
china_shared.6.a: "Yes. For now."
china_shared.6.b: "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.7.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Ceasefire"

china_shared.8.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused the offered ceasefire."

china_shared.9.t: "Formation of the United Front"
china_shared.9.d: "Ever since the Japanese invasion cries have gone up across the country for a united front against Japanese aggression, and now they have been heard. Today marks the formation of the United Front, dedicated to the expulsion of the Japanese and their influence from our Chinese soil. Now our fates are tied as one, and there can be only victory or anhiliation."
china_shared.9.a: "The Japanese must be defeated."

china_shared.10.t: "The United Front Fails"
china_shared.10.d: "It seems that not even an existential threat will unite the squabbling Chinese factions. After a month of negotiations and calls for aid, no other factions proved willing to put their differences with our regime aside - not even to stop the Japanese invasion. Our fate, apparently, is to fall divided."
china_shared.10.a: "This is a dark day..."

china_shared.11.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.11.d: "Even as the war with Japan began to move toward its close, many in China were already making covert moves toward one side or another in the post-war order. With Japan now defeated, those suppressed conflicts have again come to the fore, and what was one a united front has began a rapid slide into infighting. Now the final phase of China's unification wars has begun."
china_shared.11.a: "One last obstacle towards unification."

china_shared.12.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the United Front"
china_shared.12.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has left the United Front, decrying the alliance as now 'unnecessary' and 'limiting' to their needs and ambitions."
china_shared.12.a: "So much for unity."

china_shared.13.t: "The United Front Forms"
china_shared.13.d.pro_JAP: "It seems some of our fellow Chinese, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories, have deicded to band together against us and our Japanese allies. While Tokyo is already considering this last-ditch alliance insignificant, we know China better than they ever could, and that a long fight still awaits ahead." #Pro-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.13.d.anti_JAP: "After a string of secret meetings carried out over several weeks, several Chinese political factions including our own have agreed to stand together against the oncoming Japanese invasion. Unity has been elusive for decades, but now with the formation of the Chinese United Front the country finally stands a chance at repelling the Japanese invader, and crushing his traitorus allies." #Anti-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.13.d.JAP: "It seems that several Chinese factions, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories and the overwhelming superiority of our armies, have deicded to band together against us. It is difficult to imagine the squabbling, cliquish Chinese truly working together toward a common cause, and our commanders have assured us that theirs is ultimately a futile measure. We will be sipping Sake amid the ruins of their headquarters by the end of the year." #Japanese POV
china_shared.13.d.others: "It seems that the Chinese, in their desperation to slow the Japanese invasion of their country, have formed an alliance. Few expected the typically squabbling, cliquish Chinese factions to make such a move, and now many will watch their future with considerable interest." #Foreign POV
china_shared.13.a: "Onward."
china_shared.13.b: "Wansui!"
china_shared.13.c: "Banzai!"
china_shared.13.e: "Interesting."

china_shared.14.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.14.d.CHI: "In retrospect, the collapse of the United Front appears to have been inevitable. As a fish cannot leave the water, nor could the Front survive devoid of desperation. However, for some time, the whole of China was united behind a single purpose, marching in step toward a shared goal. Even as the dark clouds of civil war loom, there is now a shining example of what could be, and perhaps what will be, once again." #Chinese POV
china_shared.14.d.JAP: "It seems that the Chinese United Front, always beset by internal squabbling, has finally collapsed in the absence of our once overwhelming military might. Amid these days of reflection on what we might have been, an indomitable giant standing astride all of Asia, here is further proof of the dangers of western imperialism. We may have been defeated by China, but at least we remain united as one nation, beneath His Majesty the Emperor. Our destiny is still our own." #Japanese POV
china_shared.14.d.others: "The Chinese United Front, always beset by internal partisan squabbling, has finally dissolved in the absence of Japan's once overwhelming threat to its independence. The whole nation now seems set to plunge again into the fires of civil war which have consumed it, almost uninterrupted, for a generation. For many in the coastal cities and outside China this is hardly unexpected news, as the nation's tumults have  been regulars on broadsheet pages, but many experts will be paying close attention over the next several months. This round of conflict may well be China's last, as the playing-field has narrowed considerably." #Foreign POV
china_shared.14.a: "China long divided, must unite." #Chinese POV
china_shared.14.b: "We have peace while they keep chaos." #Japanese POV
china_shared.14.c: "China long united, must divide." #Foreign POV

china_shared.1000.t: "The Heirloom Seal of the Realm"
china_shared.1000.d: "The Heirloom Seal of the Realm is a long-lost Imperial artifact that once served as the official seal and stamp of approval of the Emperors of China. Crafted by the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang after consolidating the Qin Dynasty, the stamp was carved from the Heshibi - a famous and beautifully ornate jade bi, or ceremonial disc, that once belonged to the leaders of the Zhao state. The stamp, made of jade which symbolized Chinese regality and the inner beauty of humanity, was inscribed with the motto ‘Having received the Mandate of Heaven, may the Emperor lead a long and prosperous life’, and served as the official stamp of the office of the Emperor of centuries. \n\nHowever, the original Heirloom Seal was tragically lost during Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period during the 10th Century, and since then, every dynasty has tried to find it, for the stamp has come to represent the physical embodiment of the Mandate of Heaven. So desperate to find this heirloom, the Qing Dynasty of the Manchus produced hundreds of forgeries and fakes in order to depreciate the value of the original while also making it much harder to find, or if found, verified. Now that our Dynasty controls China, we must begin the search for this impossible-to-find artifact, while also producing our own fakes along the way, for whoever holds the one, true stamp has a claim to the Chinese throne."
china_shared.1000.a: "One stamp to rule them all."

mac.20000.t: "The Declaration of a Muslim China"
mac.20000.d: "Inshallah and give thanks, for we have united all of China under our clique. The great families of Ma now rule these lands without question as our armies march from Hami to Beijing, but despite all our past successes, what our future shall be is left to be decided. The main idea is to keep true to our republican history, moving to create a new Republic of China. However, our forces are split on whether we should embrace the ideals of the original Republic of China and the Xinhai Revolution, or should we blaze a new path towards republicanism under the guiding light of Allah. Distancing from these republican ideals, we could always keep our past deals with the Qing as well, and move to make a compromise with the Aisin-Gioro Clan. By casting down the fool Puyi, we could crown his cousin and devout Muslim Prince Pugong as the new Dragon Emperor of the Qing. Though this new nation would still largely function as the Qing once did, this restored dynasty would be one far more friendly to their new Hui saviors. Alternatively, we could keep these dynastic aspirations but betray the Qing fully, moving to crown one of our own as a new emperor of a new dynasty, though such an outlandish move would be reviled by most of China. Whatever we choose, China is ours. Now we just have to decide on our shared destiny."
mac.20000.a: "Proclaim a new Islamic republic free from the mistakes of the past."
mac.20000.b: "Embrace the ideals of Xinhai and the First Republic in a new form."
mac.20000.c: "By the grace of Allah and the Mandate of Heaven, proclaim the Hui Dynasty."
mac.20000.e: "Keep our word to the Qing and crown Pugong as the new Emperor."

mac.20001.t: "Crowning a Ma"
mac.20001.d: "With our wild and outlandish decision to declare a new Muslim dynasty of China, all that remains before we can take this imperial journey is to pick our new monarch. Though the first of the three (or five, depending on who you ask) has largely been subjugated and made irrelevant, the second and third Ma families, along with their extra two cousin branches, all hold many proud and honored heroes of the Ma Clique that would surely make a fitting leader for our new Hui Dynasty. Who shall be chosen to lead this new China under Allah and the Dragon Throne?"
mac.20001.a: "Ma Hongbin, the proud Chairman of Gansu, is crowned."
mac.20001.b: "Ma Hongkui, the great Socialist Slayer, is crowned."
mac.20001.c: "Ma Bufang, the civic genius and man of the people, is crowned."
mac.20001.e: "Ma Lin, patron of the Yihewani and devout Muslim, is crowned."
mac.20001.f: "Ma Buqing, the tactical genius and star general, is crowned."
mac.20001.g: "Ma Hushan, slayer of Russians and lord of Tunganistan, is crowned."
mac.20001.h: "Ma Zhongying, once named Buying and now a violent outcast, is crowned."
mac.20001.i: "Ma Fuxiang, somehow still alive, is crowned as emperor."

mac.20002.t: "A New Hierarchy"
mac.20002.d: "With [root.getleader] rising to lead all of China, the Ma families have been hard at work spreading their influence and control across these vast lands. Many prestigious and prominent members of the former Ma Clique have been given positions as governors or lords over swathes of land as new internal divisions and civic systems are organized. For example, despite their other duties, Ma Bufang has been made the lord of the Khyber Pass while Ma Hongkui now lords over Dzungaria. Ma Zhanshan rides across the lands of the Mongols as Ma Jiyuan handles Manchuria and Ma Shaowu deals with the local Korean diaspora. Ma Zhongying, once disgraced, has now been entrusted to govern the isles and archipelagoes of the South and East China Seas as Ma Hongbin climbs to the ceiling of the world to lord over the Himalayas. All across the fringes of our empire, loyal members of the main Ma families take their place under [root.getleader] as we build a new Islamic paradise under Allah and the Ma families."

### National Redoubt
china_redoubt.1.t: "The Government Flees"
china_redoubt.1.d: "One by one our defences in the East have crumbled before the enemy's advance, our armies put to flight alongside the desperate refugees now packing the roads and railways leading westward. Even now further Japanese troops pour onto the North China Plain, and the time has come for the government to consider retreat. Fortunately China is vast, and the creation of a national redoubt may let us ride out the oncoming storm. The government has already begun preparations to flee to [china_national_redoubt.GetCliqueShortName], and its offices are filled with frantic activity. But, outside, the streets of the provisional capital are filled with a dead air and sombre air, roamed only by those poor souls too wretched to flee westward. Until the enemy is defeated, there can be no looking back."

china_redoubt.2.d: "After a difficult journey across thousands of kilometers, over mountains and along narrow roads clogged with the dead and destitute, the remains of the Central Government have made their way to [china_national_redoubt.GetCliqueShortName]. For now they are safe, but it may only be a matter of time before the long arm of the Emperor reaches here, too. There is a long war ahead."
china_redoubt.2.a: "Welcome!"

china_redoubt.3.t: "The Government Returns Home"
china_redoubt.3.d: "After a long and hard-fought war, the Central Government has returned to the National Capital. But despite the return of life, many government halls once filled with activity remain silent and abandoned, their roofs reduced to ash, and their walls little more than hollowed-out rubble. It will take quite some time before the Capital, and indeed the nation, are the same again, if they ever will be."
china_redoubt.3.a: "Peace at last."
china_redoubt.3.b: "(Play as the National Government)"

china_redoubt.4.t: "We Must Flee"
china_redoubt.4.d: "Despite the best efforts of the Central Government, and all those who have stood against the Japanese advance, the time has come for us to consider retreat. Already the roads and waterways are clogged with the dead and destitute as the whole of the country moves westward, as if fleeing a flood. Now we must join them, and continue our fight from the national redoubt in [china_national_redoubt.GetCliqueShortName]."
china_redoubt.4.a: "Quickly!"
