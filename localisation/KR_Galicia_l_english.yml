### Ideas ###
GAL_karol_olbracht:0 "Cesarski Namiestnik Karol Olbracht"
GAL_karol_olbracht_desc:0 "Karol Olbracht Habsburg-Lotaryński, although Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate for the Poles within the Empire. Having inherited both his title and fascination with all things Polish from his father Karol Stefan, the most legitimate claimant to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, Karol Olbracht is in a perfect position to become a beloved and fair King to his newly adopted subjects, but that is a task far easier said than done. With the Regency in eternal deadlock, he patiently waits in Galicia as its Imperial Governor, the second most powerful position in the constituent realm and a position only legally subservient to the National Governor elected by the Sejm. With these powers, Karol Olbracht has tried everything that he can to make Galicia a better place for his subjects, and this effort has paid dividends for both the welfare of the Galician population as well as his popularity with their masses."
GAL_golicja_glodomeria:0 "Golicja i Głodomeria"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_desc:0 "The fools in Vienna have not invested in the region for decades, and this destitute reality shows gravely. Currently, Galicia stands as one of the poorest regions in wider Europe, and as the most impoverished constituent realm within the Habsburg Empire. This reality has become an unshakable reputation, with Poles from other regions jokingly referring to Galicia and Lodomeria as 'Golicja i Glodomeria', literally translating to 'Nakedia and Hungria' or more poetically, the Lands of the Naked and Hungry. This reality must be undone and through any means necessary, for our impoverished land must finally be able to feed and clothe our poor masses."
GAL_rural_society:0 "Rural Society"
GAL_rural_society_desc:0 "Wider Galician society largely consists of peasants and smallholders - a reality of tradition that has lasted for centuries in this near-idyllic rural ‘paradise’. Although the majority of the inhabitants live in scattered villages, the fragmentary nature of the population’s distribution has ensured that despite a largely agrarian socioeconomic system, most domestic agriculture is not very profitable. This harsh reality must be undone, for although we shall always be tied to the land, we are not destined to wallow in the mud."
GAL_minority_unrest:0 "Restless Minorities"
GAL_minority_unrest_desc:0 "Galicia is a land deeply divided on both ethnic and religious grounds. The largest religious group in the nation are the Roman Catholics, with nearly half of all ‘Galicians’ - mostly Poles and a small but vocal group of Austrian settlers - bowing to the Pope in Rome. Rivaling the Roman Catholics in size and influence while also bowing to the Roman Pope are the Greek Catholics, making up roughly 42% of the population compared to the 46% dominated by the Roman Catholics. Most of these Byzantine Catholics describe themselves as Ukrainians or Ruthenians (sometimes contrasting both terms), but many others instead refer to themselves as merely 'tutejsi' or locals - a novel idea in the ethnic mixing pot that is Galicia. \n\nNot to be forgotten and certainly not unheard, the Jewish population also constitutes a significant proportion of the population, dominating the non-Christian minorities and further adding to ethno-religious tensions. Fueling these fires further, Poles have held near complete power within the constituency since the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which has only intensified tensions between the bickering groups. Galicia is a box full of varied tinder ready to burn, with varied local and foreign forces both working to control the burn or let it run wild, with the very destiny of Galicia hanging in the balance."
GAL_shattered_unity:0 "Shattered Political Unity"
GAL_shattered_unity_desc:0 "With the failure of a broad political front in the days of the Great War, and with the continued domination of foreign powers over the local Polish population, Galician politics are in utter shambles. At present, confidence in Vienna is shaky at best, even though almost all legal political parties declare their support for the monarchy and despite much of the masses loving or at least tolerating Karol Olbracht. The ruling Polish People's Party and its leader Wincenty Witos are as much loved as they are despised by the general population, with the split being most apparent between the rural and urban populations. For now, it remains unclear if this agrarian-minded party of farmers can save itself from the abyss of Galician politics, or will Galicia itself succumb to its inner turmoil."

### Focuses ###

GAL_tough_year:0 "Another Tough Year in Galicia"
GAL_tough_year_desc:0 "The Years haven't been kind to poor old Galicia, a land plagued by poverty, strife and crisis. Sadly 1936 seems to be the same as every other year, despite governing agrarians best efforts to change that. At least it cannot get any worse."
GAL_downwards_spiral:0 "The Constituent Spirals Down"
GAL_downwards_spiral_desc:0 "Black Monday has proven to be the final kick to cause the crumbling structure of Austria's most devolved constituent to fall. People are rioting in the streets, factories are closing and farmers are burning their unsellable stocks. We cannot allow this to be the end."
GAL_calm_minorities:0 "Calm the Ethno-Religious Minorities"
GAL_calm_minorities_desc:0 "Galicia is a home to many minorities, the vast amount of them seeing the continued Polish political dominance as the main cause of the current crisis. If the land is to be held together and not fracture into sectarian violence we must calm them, especially in regions in which minorities form a majority in terms of numbers."
GAL_another_committee:0 "Another Supreme National Committee?"
GAL_another_committee_desc:0 "The Supreme National Committee, created to be a broad political front uniting all the political options during the Great War, ended as a failure, dividing the already fragile Galicia even more. Perhaps in the lack of any other options a second committee could be formed, hopefully with better results this time."
GAL_call_gentry:0 "Call on Ziemiaństwo"
GAL_call_gentry_desc:0 "Ziemiaństwo are the group of landed gentry, which inherited its land and manors from generation to another generation. Many of them are descendants from Commonwealth's szlachta itself. In those dire times we have to call upon them for help in saving their less fortunate brothers."
GAL_emergency_peasant:0 "Emergency Peasant Relief"
GAL_emergency_peasant_desc:0 "As more funds are gathered thanks to generous gentry as well as rich citizens we can start a programme of emergency relief. Its main goal will be to ease the burdens of our peasants, caused by the Black Monday."
GAL_contact_vienna:0 "Contact Vienna"
GAL_contact_vienna_desc:0 "While the government in Vienna, especially the bureaucrats, are not seen favourably in recent years we could still use their help in dealing with the economic downturn. Its high time someone sent an urgent telegram to the capital."
GAL_trust_market:0 "Trust the Market"
GAL_trust_market_desc:0 "After we accepted the help of Vienna and KSE the School has convinced the Sejm to implement some early pro-market policies. Hopefully the invisible hand can pick up the shattered economy of Galicia."
GAL_sell_oil:0 "Sell Off Oil Supply"
GAL_sell_oil_desc:0 "With the outreach to Vienna becoming another failure of the ruling government there is nothing else we can do. The oil supplies gathered from Borysław and Drohobycz fields has to be inspected and then sold to heal the sick economy."
GAL_special_elections:0 "Announce Special Election"
GAL_special_elections_desc:0 "Seeing as no other parties are ready to stand up and work together to overcome the crisis, Wincenty Witos has decided to ask Namiestnik Olbracht to announce a special election to be hold as soon as the time allows. The people need to decide who they trust to ensure Galicia's renewed prosperity."

### Events ###
gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish territory."
gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

gal.3.t:0 "Claiming the Bucovina"
gal.3.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, its southernmost province, the Bucovina, is home to many Romanians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.3.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.3.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.4.t:0 "Claiming East Galicia"
gal.4.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, the East is home to mostly Ukrainians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.4.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.4.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.5.t:0 "Romania Has Marched into the Bucovina"
gal.5.d:0 "An incorporation of a territory as large as Galicia was never expected to go smoothly. However what wasn't expected was meddling from the outside - Romanian troops have marched into the largely Romanian-speaking territory Bucovina, claiming the state as their own. Officials of the former Galician government have urged us to intervene."
gal.5.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.5.b:0 "Let the Romanians have what speaks Romanian."

gal.6.t:0 "The Ukraine has Seized Eastern Galicia"
gal.6.d:0 "Kraków and Lwów are the most important cities of Galicia. The integration of the former has gone smoothly over the run of the last week, however the inhabitants of the mostly Ruthenian-speaking territories surrounding Lwow have, with aid of the Ukrainian military, seized the city. The city of Lwów is too important for Poland to just let it fall into the hands of another country."
gal.6.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.6.b:0 "Ruthenians aren't Poles anyway."

gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
gal.7.d:0 "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Jozef Haller von Hallenburg in charge of Galicia in his absence."
gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."

gal.10.t:0 "Dark Clouds Over the Kingdom, Galicia in 1936"
gal.10.d:0 "The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Grand Duchy of Kraków with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator, also known simply as Galicia or Austrian Poland, was established in 1772 as a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland. After initially strong Germanization, in 1861 Galicia gained autonomy with the national parliament and the government in the capital city of Lviv. In 1867, with the establishment of a dualistic monarchy, the provincial autonomy was extended. The Austrian government guaranteed that governors would be appointed from among local Poles. The local parliament 'Sejm Krajowy' had the right to pass laws on the national economy, communication, education and health.\n\n Thanks to its extensive autonomy, Galicia became the center of the Polish independence movement. Many Polish political parties and paramilitary organizations operated here, which formed the basis of the Legions created at the beginning of the 20th century. The armed organizations established during the war, however, did not achieve their goal of winning the independence or the unification of Galician lands with Congress Kingom nor with the lands held by the German Empire.\n\n After Karl I was enthroned as the next Emperor of Austria, lands of Galicia were given an even greater degree of autonomy. Thanks to the creation of the office of Cesarsk Namiestnik (Imperial Governor), who could assume most of the rights and responsibilities of the Emperor in Vienna, Galicia could be run mostly by the Namiestnik Krajowy and the Sejm of Galicia.\n\n Yet even with the extensive autonomy the lands of Galicia are torn by ethnic strife, radical political movements, government's lack of support from other parties and rampant poverty. If the situation doesn't improve soon enough this land might devolve into a hell on earth, which is exactly what the Vienna Government as well as the current governing PSL want to avoid."
gal.10.a:0 "We shall endure."

gal.12.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Galicia!"
gal.12.d:0 "The fears of many have been finally realized. The general economic downturn exploded into a crash never seen before in the current age. The German economy collapsing took with itself every other nation invested in it, including Austria and by proxy Galicia. With Black Monday's effects raging on all around us we have to do something quick to save the already ailing nation."
gal.12.a:0 "We are doomed!"

gal.13.t:0 "A Temporary Agreement?"
gal.13.d:0 "Defying the expectations of everyone inside the ruling party, no other political force agreed to an alliance in the light of recent spiral Galicia has entered. Citing the failure of the previous Supreme National Committee formed during the war as well as the inability of PSL's government to keep Galicia out of the economic chaos, various parties have announced that they shall run candidates directly against Witos in any future election. Thus both socialist and conservatives have put an end to any hopes for a broad front inside the Sejm."
gal.13.a:0 "Curses!"

gal.14.t:0 "Imperial Demands"
gal.14.d:0 "Our urgent telegram to Vienna was answered with a demand unexpected by many. His Imperial and Royal Majesty's government agreed to send us much needed funds, on one condition that is. The Kraków School of Economics, one of the most loyal groups inside Galicia, is to be allowed inside the Sejm to institute some early recovery policies. The bureaucrats in the capital might hope that this will allow the School to gather enough popular support to run in any future election, and win."
gal.14.a:0 "We have no other choice."
gal.14.b:0 "Damn those bureaucrats, we won't allow that."

gal.15.t:0 "Snap Election"
gal.15.d:0 "Seeing no other option to maintain control, Witos has called for a snap election to the National Sejm, which Governor Karol Olbracth allowed. Having lost much of its previous support PSL stands in a perilous position, having to contest with forces both similar as well as unlike their own party.\n\n On the left stand two powerful groups, the Radical Peasants of Father Okoń and the Social Democrats of a long time leader Ignacy Daszyński. The first force advocates for a holy and moral government, combining the Church's teachings with socialism. Yet standing separate from its rigid hierarchy in favor of a Peasant Church and Agrarian Socialism. The second force calls for a great reform that would touch every aspect of the legal and economic life in Galicia. All to benefit the urban worker and allow Galicia to become the launching point of a new and independent Polish Republic.\n\n The situation on the right is in some ways much less but in some much more exciting. The Party of Nationl Right has long been a dominant force inside Galician politics, only recently losing the position to the Polish People's Party. Yet they are not as unified as it might seem from the first glance, having been split between the Kraków and Lwów factions for many decades now. Stańczycy are much less dogmatic in their conservatism than their Podolacy counterpart, who believe that democracy itself is a form of poverty.\n\n The entire population of the Kingdom, be they Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Jews or Germans, ask itself one question. Who will be tasked with saving their land after all is said and done?"
gal.15.a:0 "Polish People's Party 'Piast'"
gal.15.b:0 "Radical Peasant Party"
gal.15.c:0 "Polish Social Democratic Party"
gal.15.e:0 "Party of the National Right"
gal.15.f:0 "Kraków School of Economics"
