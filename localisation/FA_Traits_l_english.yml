MAF_goering_loyalist:0 "Göring Loyalist"
MAF_goering_loyalist_desc:0 "Serving as a member of Hermann Göring’s inner-circle, this general has proven himself to be loyal to Africa’s Bavarian madman over all others. Though this loyalty is not openly displayed within the regular hierarchy of Mittelafrika, all those close to Göring know it to be true. Like a dark and insidious web, these loyalists have spread throughout Africa and obey their charismatic leader over the word of any Staathalter or Kaiser. Fiercely loyal and experienced in warfare and colonial suppression, these members of Göring’s clique are a force to be reckoned with."
MAF_old_guard:0 "Alten Kämpfer"

Standing as the veterans of both the Weltkrieg and the Kaiserreich’s first forays into the Dark Continent, this Old Guard serves as the upper echelon of Mittelafrika’s hierarchy. Both respected by all and reviled by many for standing as a roadblock to real changes in Mittelafrika, these Old Fighters are the foremost Kaiser loyalists in the colony, as well as his most trusted colonial servants." 

NYC_police_officer:0 "NYPD Officer"
NYC_police_officer_desc:0 "A member of the Boys in Blue, this general has little to no formal military training, but has served as a valiant and extensively trained police officer within the highly militarized New York Police Department - the largest police force in America’s history. Trained by the NYPD in a variety of different skills and disciplines that every officer must excel at, these coppers typically use a variety of strategies focusing on intense teamwork and close-knit squad tactics while being drilled to be loyal and dedicated to the Job and the City at all costs. Unwaveringly brave and heroic in the face of danger, may they protect and serve."
NYC_mobster:0 "Mobster"
NYC_mobster_desc:0 "Whether affiliated with the Commission, the Harlem kingpins, or any other of the dozens of criminal outfits within the Big Apple and our surrounding territories, this particular ‘general’ is more mobster than career soldier. A professional criminal at heart whose experience at command comes from leading other mafiosos on the streets, these men are particularly hard officers and ruthless, with a talent for unorthodox tactics, though usually prone to insubordination or disorganization. A valuable asset in any urban scrap, just be careful of their short tempers and penchant for vice and sin."
