chr.1.t:0 "The Year Without a Christmas"
chr.1.d:0 "Less than a week ago, on December 25th, 1935, children all across the world awoke to what should have been a happy, wholesome day of fun, peace, love, and merry-making. Instead however, children all around the globe woke not to presents, not to filled socks, but to nothing. Cookies and Milk that had been left out for Santa Claus went uneaten, and that holiday spirit and joy was replaced by anger and depression. This shock has not been felt just by kids, but parents as well, and many parent groups have begun to pressure the government to act, and try and find out just what happened to Ol' Saint Nick. While obviously being little more than a headache, parent groups have almost no say within the halls of power anyway, many are wondering if we should simply give in to just stop the noise. Others, ardent believers in Santa themselves, are pushing hard for us to investigate the happenings in the North Pole, fearing that something must have happened to Santa that led to Christmas being cancelled. Regardless of what we do, the world has gone it's first year without a Christmas, and unless something changes, it seems that Christmas as we knew it may be over forever..." 
chr.1.a:0 "Bah Humbug! Santa isn't even real!" 
chr.1.b:0 "Send a team to the North Pole, just to be safe." 
chr.1.c:0 "This is urgent! Use everything at our disposal to fix this! (Play as Santa's Workshop)"


chr.2.t:0 "The Workshop into 1936"
chr.2.d:0 "The Workshop, also known as the North Pole or Santa's Realm, is perhaps the world's best worst keep secret. All children know that the North Pole is where Santa Claus, his army of elves, his team of reindeer and of course Mrs. Claus reside, constructing toys for all the good boys and girls of the world, at least it was. Since the summer of 1935, Santa Claus has been missing, and his absence has been felt throughout the world. St Nick has been known to take a small period of time for vacation in the summer, liking to spend time in the sweltering heat of the world's warmest places for a few weeks. Wishing to keep to himself during this period of rest, save for the reindeer who deliver him, Santa's destination is known to him alone, much to Mrs. Claus' chagrin. During this time, he leaves the workshop in the care of his beloved wife, who is quite the capable administrator. However, as weeks turned into mouths, it was quite evident something had happened to Father Christmas. Even following extensive use of the magical Sight, Santa was unable to be located.\n\nExactly what happened to Santa is still a mystery, but what can be confirmed is that Santa lives yet, as the Coat of Saint Nicholas has yet to return. If Santa, for whatever reason, dies, the Coat entices a nearby person to put on the Coat and become the next Santa, ensuring that a Santa will also live. If the prompted person does not put on the Coat, it returns by itself to the North Pole, were the Regency Clause comes into effect a new Santa may thus be chosen. Due to neither the appearance of a new Santa nor the Coat itself, Santa himself can be inferred to be alive.\n\nThe lack of Santa has created clear and dangerous rifts within the workshop. The Elven workforce, long harboring small voices of dissent which had been addressed at every turn by Santa, have begun radicalizing, creating Syndicalist styled unions in opposition to the preexisting Giftmaker's Guild. These Unions of the so-called 'Elfletariat' have called a general strike in an effort to usher in revolution, which has crippled the Workshop's economy. Seeing this weakness and chaos, the radical legalists of the Toyist Clique, one thought to have been destroyed, have been making moves around the Workshop, with toy soldiers being sighted regularly near the outskirts of the Workshop. What's more, the ever present forces of the Miser Brothers have been sighted closer and closer to the Workshop. While we are nominally allied to Snow Miser, following Mrs. Claus going over the Miser Brothers' head as Santa was having a crisis of faith, both Heat and Snow Miser have held a grudge against her. With Santa missing, Elven Intelligence suggests that the brothers view us as weak enough to get payback. The Grinch, a long time foe of the Workshop, has not been siting idle. Exactly what the Grinch has been doing is unknown, but reports of seeing a green figure sneaking around before various gift depots go up in flames has been reported.\n\nEven with all of these threats, Mrs. Claus' rule is still quite strong. While lacking the charisms of Santa, Mrs. Claus has been able to maintain a solid enough grip that these threats have simply been annoyances. However, with Christmas 1935 being the first giftless Christmas in a millennia and with the support of a backing nation behind them, it is expected that once Mrs. Claus can get a handle on the most pressing issues, the search for Santa shall be greatly expanded, until Santa is found. If Mrs. Claus is able to find Santa, or falls to one of the various threats facing the Workshop remains to be seen."
chr.2.a:0 "Merry Christmas to all?"

chr.3.t:0 "The Hunt for Santa"
chr.3.d:0 "The time has come - we must finally embark to sweep the magical realm in order to find Santa. We must now decide who we shall turn to in order to find help in this quest, but must be wary as we may be beholden to whomever we choose."
chr.3.a:0 "Seek help from the elemental Miser Brothers."
chr.3.b:0 "Join in with the Toy Loyalists led by the impostor Toy Santa."
chr.3.c:0 "We will find Santa ourselves!"

chr.4.t:0 "They're Too Much!"
chr.4.d:0 "Despite our hope and goodwill, the Miser Brothers have taken advantage of our weak position, and have couped Ms. Claus! Now, the brothers of ice and fire battle it out within the Workshop, with the fate of the North Pole and the wider world all hanging in the balance. As the fighting rages and the forces of Winter and Summer battle it out for good, who rises above the other victorious as the frost and flames settle."
chr.4.a:0 "Mr. White Christmas himself, the Snow Miser, freezes his brother solid."
chr.4.b:0 "Mr. Green Christmas himself, the Heat Miser, melts his brother into a puddle."

chr.5.t:0 "Toy Santa's Return"
chr.5.d:0 "Despite our hope and goodwill, the Long exiled Toyist Clique betrayed us on the hunt for Santa, and now move to secure the Workshop for themselves as they topple Mrs. Claus’ regime. However, the striking elves under Comrade Carey refuse to work for this coal-slinging slaver, and the Elfletariat has declared a full-blown Revolution! As nutcrackers fight elves in the streets and forges across the North Pole, the fate of Santa’s Workshop dangles in the balance."
chr.5.a:0 "Toy Santa and the Toyists crush the Elfletariat. The Age of Coal shall begin!"
chr.5.b:0 "Comrade Carey and the Elfletariat’s revolution succeed! A Red Christmas shall rise for all!"


chr.6.t:0 "The Grinch Extends A Green Hand in Aid"
chr.6.d:0 "Working by ourselves to find Santa has proved fruitless so far, but we did find someone willing to help out in these frozen wastes. Passing by the quaint little town of Whoville, we happened upon an odd, green, and furry being who smelled something foul. Calling himself the Grinch, he has offered a hand in helping us find Santa. However, many within our party are wary of such an offer. What should we do?"
chr.6.a:0 "I wouldn’t touch him with a 39-and-a-half foot pole!"
chr.6.b:0 "What’s the worst that could happen? Accept his offer!"

chr.7.t:0 "Santa is Found!"
chr.7.d:0 "Praise all the gods of Winter, old and new! We have found Santa at last! It turns out he was imprisoned by his evil doppelganger Toy Santa, who had kept him right under our noses as he planned to take over the Workshop. With Santa finally returned to us, Christmas is saved at last!"
chr.7.a:0 "Santa Claus is coming to town!"

chr.8.t:0 "The Grinch Marches on the Workshop"
chr.8.d:0 "We shouldn’t have trusted that foul and despicable beast! The Grinch led our search party astray in the frozen wastes and seized the Workshop for himself! Santa is missing and the Grinch has stolen Christmas, and now the North is his to do with as he pleases."
chr.8.a:0 "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch!"

chr.9.t:0 "The Death of Santa"
chr.9.d:0 "After much searching and preparation, the vile Saint Nick has at last been found. As it turns out, Santa had crashed just after takeoff on Christmas Eve, 1935. The Fat Man of the North than wondered in seemingly all directions, clueless as to where he was, and it was in this state of cluelessness that he had been found in.  At least that is the official story that our government is telling the people of the Workshop. In reality, Toy Santa had captured Santa in a daring raid. Up until this day, Santa had been kept neatly in Toy Santa's Fortress. Regardless, with the real Santa being 'found' at last, the time has come to do what must be done. Santa is to be executed by fire squad in the morning for his crimes against the Workshop. While few expected us to take such a radical action, due to the sheer amount of Santa supporters that still hide among us, his death shall serve as an example. With his death, the final preparation will be completed, and soon we can show the world just what has become of the Workshop. "
chr.9.a:0 "Santa's reign is over, at last."

This is an age of debauchery and madness, where people care not for anyone who is different than them. Thus, Toy Santa decrees that all are naughty! The list has been torn to shreds, for all naughty children of the world will receive the same gift: shrapnel!"
CHR_commie_elves:0 "Rise of the Elfletariat"
CHR_commie_elves_desc:0 "Finally getting all she wanted for Christmas after staging a successful coup against the tyrant and false saint that was Evil Santa, Mariah Carey - also known as Comrade Snowball by her troops or the Red Witch of the Elves by her foes - has conquered the North Pole. Utilizing the endless legions of Santa’s Little Helpers, Comrade Carey shall now guide the Elfletatiat towards pure and winterified Syndicalist utopia. Elfs of the World, Unite!"
CHR_finish_toyists:0 "Melt the Toyists!"
CHR_finish_toyists_desc:0 "Evil Santa’s toy-making loyalist clique, the Toyists, still exist in small numbers, though most have already joined the righteous ranks of the Elfletariat. Isolated in small pockets and few in number, we shall round up these Toyists and subject them to a final judgement. All those found guilty of betraying the Revolution of the Elfletariat shall be melted down in the reject-toy smeltery. All those found innocent, if any even are, shall be given a choice: join Comrade Carey’s revolutionary struggle, or be cast into the fiery pits at the heart of the North Pole’s vast toy foundries."
CHR_purge_santa_loyalists:0 "The Years Without Santa Claus"
CHR_purge_santa_loyalists_desc:0 "Although the one, true Santa Claus is still missing, his loyalists still remain, with many even infiltrating our very party! - or so Comrade Carey claims. We must root out and eradicate every last trace of these traitors to the Elfletariat in order to secure the Revolution! No iceberg, no snowbank, no frozen cavern or crowded toy-factory will go unchecked, and every level of the Party’s hierarchy shall be evaluated, for every single traitor must be found so that the ambitions of Comrade Carey and the Elfletariat may triumph!"
CHR_all_i_want:0 "All I Want for Christmas Is Revolution"
CHR_all_i_want_desc:0 "With all enemies of the state mostly eradicated and with our powerbase secure, Comrade Carey has declared that all she wants for Christmas is total Revolution! That is to say, our glorious and magnetic leader desires nothing less than complete societal transformation, metamorphosing the North Pole, and eventually the entire world, into a Syndicalist Utopia with Christmas characteristics. All of society shall be totalized, Christmasized, and Syndicalized as Comrade Carey leads the Elfletariat to pure joy and cheer in their purest forms."
CHR_collective_gift:0 "The Gift of Present Collectivization"
CHR_collective_gift_desc:0 "All power and the means of gift production must be transferred to the hands of the Elfletariat in order to safeguard complete Socialization and Elgaritarianization of the state. A nationalized and planned gift-making economy shall be formed, with all ownership being collectively shared by all Elfkind, but administered and overseen by the Party and by Comrade Carey directly, so that true Syndicalist Utopia and economic prosperity can be achieved for the people of the North Pole."
CHR_christmas_party:0 "Formalize the 'Christmas' Party"
CHR_christmas_party_desc:0 "Comrade Carey makes a lot of references to a wider ‘Party’ that binds us, but until now, no such formal organization existed, for our uprising was so ramshackle and grassroots-orientated that no formal all-encompassing organizational body ever naturally coalesced until her rise. To remedy this, a new Christmas Party shall be organized, binding all loyal citizens of the state and of the Elfletariat together under Comrade Carey and the arms of the revolutionary regime. Together, we shall reach a red and frosty Utopia."
CHR_the_red_noise:0 "Rudolph the Truly Red"
CHR_the_red_noise_desc:0 "Reindeer have long served Santa Claus and his forces - majestic cervids with great intelligence and the amazing ability to fly used as nothing more than slave-beasts for that foolish old ‘Saint.’ Rallying and rebranding their breed behind the mutant freak Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - whose nose is a naturally-occuring Syndicalist symbol ordained by God or some Winter deity or by some aberration of a natural process - we shall utilize these amazing animals to fit the needs of the state and the Christmas Party."

Outside the snow is falling and Elves are calling ‘Yoo-hoo!’ Come on, it's lovely weather for a Syndicalist Utopia with you! \nUnder Comrade Carey, the North Pole has been bathed in Red - both of the blood of our enemies and the Red of both Christmas and Syndicalism. Now, we must gather our strength and lick the wounds wrought by out growing pains, for the world calls for a Red Christmas for all!"

CHR_kill_santa_desc:0 "To out great luck, we have found the real, and once lost, Santa Claus. Fitting of a man of his status and fame, we shall put the execution of this fat fool on display, for all the world to see. We will show all that this Saint Nick isn’t so saintly, especially when his head rolls across the floor!"

CHR_grinch:0 "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
CHR_grinch_desc:0 "Raging against the regime of the false Santa and the idea of Christmas itself, the infamous Grinch has seized control of the North.

CHR_the_empty_hole:0 "Your Heart's an Empty Hole"
CHR_the_empty_hole_desc:0 "Humans are a void, and the Grinch is the embodiment of the emptiness. Humanity has thrown away all the good in the world in the search of self-gain, satisfaction, and material wealth - the very antithesis of the true holiday spirit. The mistakes of humanity shall be corrected - their hearts made from empty holes and garlic souls to true and wholesome and pure - and all that cannot be saved shall be eradicated."

CHR_stink_stank_stunk_desc:0 "The stink, stank, stunk of humanity is as revolting as the yellow teeth and unkempt green fur of their vile avatar. The Grinch is the icon of this disgust and pestilence - a herald of their decaying sin and rotting ambition. By the Grinch’s hand, these maladies will be wiped clean and expunged, totally."

CHR_mangle_gifts_with_tangled_up_knots_desc:0 "In a masquerade bordering on plain mockery, the Grinch has decided to don the outfit of the true Santa Claus, with his beloved and berated dog Max following suit by wearing a reindeer antler in solidarity. Dressing in the big, red suit and cap, the Grinch shall become a shadowy and sinful mirror of the old Saint Nick, for he is gone, and the Grinch is the new lord of winter and Christmas from now on."

These sins plague Humanity and the wider world, rotting our society to the very core atop a mountain of waste and hollow want.

CHR_seasick_crocodiles:0 "The Tender Sweetness of a Seasick Crocodile"
CHR_seasick_crocodiles_desc:0 "Given a choice between the wasteful sinners of this world and a ravenous seasick crocodile, a sane man would pick the croc every time. There is no saving Humanity, for their heart is full of unwashed socks and their soul is full of gunk like their avatar Mr. Grinch. There is no saving this dreadful, reptilian lot."

CHR_three_decker_sauerkraut_toadstool_desc:0 "The fools that still celebrate this false holiday of greed and selfish desire still go on, enjoying their fattening feasts like suckling pigs. However, like suckling pigs, they are also ripe for slaughter! We shall poison every Christmas and holiday feast on Earth, for the world will come to hate this holiday one way or another!"

Rising to become the saviour and herald of Christmas, the Grinch has saved the holiday season for all! They say that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day, and though this may be the sign of an underlying health condition, the world is all the better for it. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"

You really are a heel. You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch. You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!’"
