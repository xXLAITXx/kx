### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikong, Pedro VIII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German’s control of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment.Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo. We must reclaim this destiny, though we will likely be forced to work with the Portuguese in order to achieve it."

cog.1.d:0 "Portugal, our former colonial overlord, which dethroned us and kicked us out of our ancestral home of Mbanza Kongo, now demands us to bend the knee. In return, we will be granted our capital back, in addition to the region of Cabinda. If we refuse, it's almost certain they will issue a declaration of war."
cog.1.a:0 "Our survival in these trying times is more important than our pride."
cog.1.b:0 "We will meet them in battle!"

cog.2.t:0 "Kongo accepts"
cog.2.d:0 "The Manikong has accepted our offer and submitted, bringing peace to his lands. In return, we will allow him to keep his German equipment and personnel, with a large degree of autonomy. Now, however, Portugal can finally claim ownership of the Congo."
cog.2.a:0 "Welcome back!"
