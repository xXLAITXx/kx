After the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War, the Left SRs consolidated their power as a true syndicalist force, taking inspiration from the successful syndicalist revolution in France. The party promotes revolutionary syndicalism based on voluntary association of autonomous labor collectives and trade union cooperatives.§!"
