Thank you for downloading Kaiserredux!

Easy Guide to install KX Github version:
-Download the zip of the mod with the green button here: https://github.com/JoeBidenWhatAreYouHiding/kx
-Open your hoi4 launcher and scroll down to Mod Tools button, click it and create a blank mod (name doesnt matter)
-Copy/Paste the entire contents of the KX github zip file into the blank mod file you just created (in ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod) and replace all contents when prompted
-enable the new manual KX mod in the launcher mod list and enjoy
 
Note: You can also just download the GitHub desktop app and install KX through that: download the GitHub desktop app, open the app and click "file" on the topbar, clone the kx repository to your hoi4 mod file location as the local path (NOT the steam mod folder, the mod folder in your ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod folder) using the URL of the KX github (https://github.com/JoeBidenWhatAreYouHiding/kx.git) as the source - this allows easy 1-click updates with every new git-push using the github app.
Either installation method may require you to edit the descriptor file in a text editor to change the mod's installation path in case your documents folder is somwhere else
